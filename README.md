Wireless IoT Device for Sensing Application
Wireless sensor networks consisting of spatially distributed autonomous sensor nodes with wireless interface have found wide applications in industry and consumer applications. The successful demonstrations of whispering-gallery-mode sensors, e.g., thermal sensors, humidity sensors, magnetic field sensors, particle sensors, have proved themselves to be good candidates for sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks. One of the largest obstacles for exploiting whispering-gallery-mode sensors in wireless sensor networks is the remote control of the system and acquisition of the sensing data. In this work, we demonstrate a miniature whispering-gallery-mode sensor with wireless interface for thermal sensing. The system parameters and sensing signals can be fully acquired, adjusted and analyzed by a customized iOS app in smartphones. Our work paves the way to the large deployment of whispering-gallery-mode sensors in wireless sensor networks as well as Internet of Things, and may also broaden the current technologies of wireless sensor networks.
